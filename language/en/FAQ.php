"<font size=3>Which raw materials are there?</font>" => "The main raw materials are metal, crystal and deuterium. These are needed for buildings, research, shipbuilding, engineering and the making of defenses. The energy lets your mines works work on 100%. If you produce less energy as you need, your production of the raw materials is reduced.<br>",
"<font size=3>What is the small green number under the raw materials?  </font>" => "This number indicates your storage size. If the stores are full, your buildings produce no more raw materials.<br>",
"<font size=3>What is dark matter and where do I need these for?   </font>" => "Dark matter is a special raw material which is not produced by a building. With this raw material you can get temporary bonusses and staff with bonusses under the category Officers. The temporary bonusses usually last for 24 hour.<br>Furthermore you need dark matter for the market place. You can deal for 750 dark matter there, and swap your raw materials (metal, crystal, deuterium) with the dealer.<br><br>You can get dark matter in 2 different ways: <br>1 In the galaxy you can explore planet 16 with your fleet, this can return you dark matter but be aware, your fleet also can be destroyed.<br>2 If you have a moon and the ship Inter. DM-Collector, you must send the ship to your moon for exploration. However, the ship destroys itself if Dark Matter was found and the ship has unloaded itself.",
"<font size=3>Where can I improve my buildings? </font>" => "You can build/extend your buildins under the menu tab buildings. <br>You can put up to 5 buildings in a waitinglist. <br>If you, however, dont have sufficient resources for the following buildings in the waitinglist, the waitinglist is cancelled.",
"<font size=3>Which purpose does downgrading my buildings fulfil?</font>" => "Every planet has only a certain number of buildable fields. Every building and its level needs 1 free field <br>With researches and improving you buildings (for example Deuterium powerplant) your production can be increased and you can remove any unnessecary buildings by downgrading.<br>Downgrading buildings/levels requires some time and in addition will cost you some resources.",
"<font size=3>Where can I see how much my buildings produce?</font>" => "In the left menu under the tab Production you can see how much materials are being produced or consumed.<br>In addition, you can adjust your production rate at which % your buildings shall work. The less they work, the lower the energy consumption is of the building. ",
"<font size=3>What does Technology means in the left menu?</font>" => "In the techtree you can see all researches, ships, buildings and defences there are in the game.<br>In addition, you can see what is needed for unlocking certain technologies and which ones you already have.",
"<font size=3>What is the purpose of the combat simulator?   </font>" => "This was developed to make a small insight into the battle system for you. In addition, you also can simulate a fight to predict its outcome.",
"<font size=3>What can I expect under the left menu tab: Galaxy? </font>" => "The galaxy shows you your planets in the space and also the ones of your teammates and enemies. You can also make certain actions form the galaxy view to attack other planets. <br>You can switch between the systems in the galaxy to check out the neighbourhood but caution, each system you view costs you 10 deuterium.<br>To execute an action, you must click on the desired position (1-16). After that you see a list of your available fleetactions.<br>For example transport, select your ships for your mission, then adjust the speed, fill in the amount of resources (be aware of your cargo capacity) and start the mission. You then can see in the fleettab which of your fleets perform which actions and when they are ended.",
"<font size=3>Everybody attacks me, how can I protect myself? </font>"=> "The most important is: Not to panic. Who is hectic usually makes mistakes.   <br>First have a look to which planet the opposing fleet is flying and how long they still need.<br>You have the following possibilities: secure your raw materials and fleet, prepare yourself for the fight, or using up your raw materials but this is more or less senseless.<br> <br> <b>Safeguarding raw materials & fleet: </b><br>If you have one or multiple ships then click on galaxy and choose an occupied planet in your proximity.<br>Select your ships and resources, select the mission transport and send your fleet there. Simply break off the flight of your fleet when the attack should be past at your fleettab.<br>You can also secure your ships and resources if you are absent for some time. Make sure you select your ships, the mission transport and fill in 1 resources uni to start the mission.<br>The fleet will fly to the target planet, unloads this raw material and returns without losses again. There are also more saveflight tricks, but these are explained further below in this FAQ.",
"<font size=3>I would like to have more planets, how do I do this?   </font>" => "You need one Colonyship, this is a ship which can colonise a new planet for your empire. <br>Choose in the galaxyview an unoccupied free planet and send your Colonyship on the colonise mission to this planet.<br>The number of your planets is restricted to 9.  <br><br>The research astrophysics makes it possible for you to colonise 1 more planet per 2 levels you research. ",
"<font size=3>Are there different planets?  </font>" => "Yes, the position of the planet a role. Position 0 always means the sun. The nearer a planet that is to the sun, the hotter the planet is, is it further away from the sun then it will be colder. You see in the following table which advantages and disadvantages the hot and cold planets have:<br><br><center><table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" align=\"center\"
